### Backlog: Proposed Next

* 271\. Transformation from python AST to C-CST exists/works - for simplest possible function
* 268\. Code generation for very basic functions succeeds. (no args, return values or variables)
* 267\. Analysis of functions not using any variables succeeds (no args, no return values)
* 221\. Initial spike support for function definitions. (no args, no return values)
* 273\. Code generation for functions has cross overs for that of identifier definition.
* -----------------------------
* 223\. Spike support for functions with basic arguments.
* 222\. Spike support for functions which use local variables
* 251\. Profile Context is usable for defining externally defined methods (for typechecking)
* 227\. .get_type() should be delegated, not rely on internal pynode details.
* 15\. Refactor code generation #refactor #internals
* 16\. Find Variables duplicates effort from the analysis phase, while also relying on results from it #internals
* 17\. Transform step is throwing away data. This seems broken and should perhaps pass through decorated pynodes - or at least retain a reference. #internals
* 58\. Blog Post: Pyxie Decisions #website
