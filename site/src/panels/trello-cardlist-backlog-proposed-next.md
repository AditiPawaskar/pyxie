### Backlog: Proposed Next

* 3\.5 Analysis code looks for an arduino profile file describing c-types appropriately.
* 203\. Arduino profile supports delayMicroseconds
* 205\. Arduino profile supports analogRead
* 3\.8 Arduino compiled programs can use values returned from functions.
* 206\. Arduino profile supports millis()
* 221\. Initial spike support for function definitions. (no args, no return values)
* 223\. Spike support for functions with basic arguments.
* 222\. Spike support for functions which use local variables
* 213\. v0 Playful Puppy code analyses
* 214\. v0 Playful Puppy code generates code
* 215\. v0 Playful Puppy code compiles, and runs on device correctly
* 196\. Batch Compiler
* 195\. Functionality of bin/pyxie-dev is in core, not a script
* 3\.6 arduino profile file is propogated with something relating to core functions that read values, to avoid forcing types "manually"
