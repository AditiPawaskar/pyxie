### Arising and Internal

* Truthiness for values that AND/OR/NOT arguments needs resolving properly in C. (deferred)
* Truthiness of expressions is explicitly checked/valid - for us in if and while statements and boolean expressions
* Website could do with some pictures :-)
* Should we allow comments on website?
* Currently have 2 shift/reduce conflicts. They're auto-resolved correctly, but could be worth seeing if they could be resolved better.
* Consider using CppHeaderParser on the C++ side of things - to inform the code generation side of things
* Block structure of generated C Code is pretty/human friednly/readable
* Operations and operators could be unified with a bit of tweaking - using "x.operation", not "x.tag/x.comparison" etc
* Better Error messages for users
* Duplication exists within code generation for operators. (cf convert_operator etc)
