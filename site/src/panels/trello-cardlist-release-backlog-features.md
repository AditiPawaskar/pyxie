### Release Backlog: Features

* 0\.0.19 = = = = = = = = = =
* 230\. Implementation can generate code for myservo.attach(pin)
* 227\. .get_type() should be delegated, not rely on internal pynode details.
* 225\. Implementation of attribute access is sufficient for arduino profile.
* 201\. Arduino profile supports Servos
* 221\. Initial spike support for function definitions. (no args, no return values)
* 222\. Spike support for functions which use local variables
* 223\. Spike support for functions with basic arguments.
* 3\.5 Analysis code looks for an arduino profile file describing c-types appropriately.
* 207\. Arduino profile supports constants "HIGH", "LOW", "OUTPUT"
* 202\. Arduino profile supports digitalWrite
* 203\. Arduino profile supports delayMicroseconds
* 204\. Arduino profile supports pinMode
* 205\. Arduino profile supports analogRead
* 206\. Arduino profile supports millis()
* 209\. Parsing of Servo.attach() method call works as you'd expect
* 210\. Parsing of Servo.writeMicroseconds() method call works as you'd expect
* 213\. v0 Playful Puppy code analyses
* 214\. v0 Playful Puppy code generates code
* 215\. v0 Playful Puppy code compiles, and runs on device correctly
