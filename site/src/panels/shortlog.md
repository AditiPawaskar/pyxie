* 0.0.15 - 2015-07-18 - clib converted to py clib for adding to build directory
* 0.0.14 - 2015-07-18 - For loops implemented. Added clib code, C++ generator implementation, FOR loop style test harness, parsing and basic analysis of of FOR loops using a range interator
* 0.0.13 - 2015-06-21 - if/elif/else,conditionals/boolean/parenthesised expressions.
* 0.0.12 - 2015-06-16 - While loops, break/continue, Website, comparison operators, simple benchmark test
* 0.0.11 - 2015-06-06 - Function calls; inclusion of custom  C++ headers; empty statements; language spec updates
* 0.0.10 - 2015-06-03 - Analysis phase to make type inference work better. Lots of related changes. Implementation of expression statements.
* 0.0.9 - 2015-05-23 - Grammar changed to be left, not right recursive. (Fixes precedence in un-bracketed expressions) Added standalone compilation mode - outputs binaries from python code.
* 0.0.8 - 2015-05-13 - Internally switch over to using node objects for structure - resulting in better parsing of expressions with variables and better type inference.
* 0.0.7 - 2015-04-29 - Structural, testing improvements, infix operators expressions (+ - * / ) for integers, precdence fixes
* 0.0.6 - 2015-04-26 - Character Literals, "plus" expressions, build/test improvements
* 0.0.5 - 2015-04-23 - Core lexical analysis now matches language spec, including blocks
* 0.0.4 - 2015-04-22 - Mixed literals in print statements
* 0.0.3 - 2015-04-21 - Ability to print & work with a small number of variables
