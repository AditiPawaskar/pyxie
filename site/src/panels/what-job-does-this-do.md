### What job does / will this do?

The aim of this project is to allow a adults and children to write code in a
familiar high level language that can then be compiled to run on an arbitrary
embedded system - that is devices with very low power CPUs and very little memory.
(ie devices too small to host a python interpreter/runtime) 

It's pre-alpha at the moment.

It will be useful in supporting things like the The Scout Association's "Digital
Maker" badge. That's a fair way off though.
