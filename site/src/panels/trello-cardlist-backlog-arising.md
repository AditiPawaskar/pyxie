### Backlog: Arising

* 13\. Pyxie compile harness supports custom working directories #practicalities
* 14\. Code Cleanups #refactor #internals
* 15\. Refactor code generation #refactor #internals
* 16\. Find Variables duplicates effort from the analysis phase, while also relying on results from it #internals
* 17\. Transform step is throwing away data. This seems broken and should perhaps pass through decorated pynodes - or at least retain a reference. #internals
* 18\. Code generation of C literals is muddled up a touch with structural representation #internals
* 19\. Website should use responsive CSS #website
* 20\. Website side bar could be better implemented. #website
* 21\. Truthiness for values that AND/OR/NOT arguments needs resolving properly in C. (deferred) #pylang
* 22\. Truthiness of expressions is explicitly checked/valid - for us in if and while statements and boolean expressions #pylang #internals
* 23\. Website could do with some pictures :-) #website
* 24\. Currently have 2 shift/reduce conflicts. They're auto-resolved correctly, but could be worth seeing if they could be resolved better. #pylang #internals
* 25\. Consider using CppHeaderParser on the C++ side of things - to inform the code generation side of things #internals #pylang
* 26\. Block structure of generated C Code is pretty/human friendly/readable #internals
* 27\. Operations and operators could be unified with a bit of tweaking - using "x.operation", not "x.tag/x.comparison" etc #internals #refactor
* 28\. Better Error messages for users #pylang #practicalties
* 29\. Duplication exists within code generation for operators. (cf convert_operator etc) #internals #refactor
* 30\. Should we allow comments on website? #website
