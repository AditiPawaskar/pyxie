Pyxie uses a number of models for different purposes

## iiNodes - Abstract Syntax Tree -- NEEDS IMPLEMENTING PROPERLY

Designed to be an abstract representation of the program - which is created from pynodes, and designed
to make it simpler to create Cnodes.


## cppnodes - Concrete Syntax Tree -- NEEDS MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT...

These are designed to represent a C program which can be generated directly from these.


## Pynodes - Concrete Syntax Tree

These are created by the parser front end, and directly represent python programs.
They're divided into the following *organisational* categories:

base_nodes.py:
    PyNode: PyOperation, PyStatement

operators.py:
    PyBoolOperator, PyAndOperator, PyOrOperator, PyNotOperator, PyComparisonOperator

    PyOperator, PyTimesOperator, PyDivideOperator, PyPowerOperator, PyPlusOperator, PyMinusOperator

statements.py:

    PyExpressionStatement, PyFunctionCall, PyAssignment
    PyDefStatement
    PyForLoop, PyWhileStatement, PyBreakStatement, PyContinueStatement

    PyIfStatement, PyElIfClause, PyElseClause
    PyEmptyStatement, PyPassStatement

structural.py:
    PyProgram, PyBlock, PyStatements, PyExprList

values.py:
    PyValueLiteral
    PyAttribute, PyAttributeAccess, PyIdentifier, ProfilePyNode
    PyString, PyCharacter, PyBoolean
    PyNumber, PyFloat, PyInteger, PySignedLong, PyUnSignedLong, PyHex, PyOctal, PyBinary
